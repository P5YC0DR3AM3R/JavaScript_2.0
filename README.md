Below is a short description explaining the what, why, and how of my project. I have use thed following questions as a guide:

### - What was your motivation?
I was motivated to build this page using JavaScript code to practice building and debugging a website.
### - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
This has been the hardest homework, so far.  It was extremely challenging, but it will be useful as a reference tool for future builds.
### - What problem does it solve?
It provides a list of data that is searchable and archiveable.
### - What did you learn?
